You'll need to build the medic-core package from source, and then place the
resulting tree of binaries inside the medic-core directory. Change your current
working directory to the root of this repository, then run something like this:

  $ cd source/medic-core
  $ make ROOT=/srv/software/medic-core/1.2.0/x86 BITS=32 PARALLEL=4
  $ ./scripts/prepare-dist

To move the newly-compiled software in to place, and allow the Makefile to pick
it up properly, execute the following (again, from the root of the repository):

  $ mv /srv/software/medic-core/* packages/medic-core/software/medic-core/
